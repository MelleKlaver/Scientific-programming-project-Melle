In this github you will find an in depth analysis of Quarterback statistics performed in R. More specifically you will find a calculation
of the effect of age on QB play, an improved way of looking at the passer rating and an overview of career stats from all QB's that have 
played from 1961 onwards. Downloading the neccesary files and running the markdown R file should result in the creation of all the plots and graphs
